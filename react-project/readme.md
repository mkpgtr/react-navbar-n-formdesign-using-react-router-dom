# Live link : react-router-dom-forms-by-manish-v2.netlify.app


### please use the command npm install to install all dependencies in the package.json

### I used Vite for this project instead of Create React APP. 

1. My create-react-app was causing problems so I tried Vite.
2. Vite is way faster than create-react-app.

### Things I learnt

1. Using react Router DOM to link the particular pages.
2. Using React Router DOM Outlet Component to maintain a navbar across pages and rendering child routes.
3. Using isActive prop in Navlink component(from react-router-dom) to add custom style to active link.


### Responsive layout

1. Simple media queries along with bootstrap container fluid.

### Rendering links using map function in React.

1. Except the logout link which is a dummy link in fact, rest of them are all dynamically coming from an object.

### Added google Poppins Font

1. Added the link in the index.html file.
2. Then added the font-family in .content-container class(which wraps all the content inside the jsx).

# Designed Forms 

1. But did not add state or controlled inputs.

### Making Websites/Webapplications

1. So easy to build with ReactJS.
2. This project cleared all my doubts regarding how to use react-router-dom and the Outlet component.
